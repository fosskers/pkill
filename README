ABOUT PKILL
-----------
Don't feel like fiddling around with grep and kill to stop that runaway
process that isn't acting the way it should?
With pkill, you can kill it by name!

pkill iTunes   # Bye bye iTunes!
pkill Firefox  # Bye bye Firefox!

Need more power? Force the kill!

pkill -f Firefox  # Someone was being a bad boy.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
pkill is a python script that is compatible from 2.6 upwards through 3.2.
To run it, you'll need to be using Linux, OSX, or Cygwin in Windows.

INSTALLING PKILL
----------------
Download the source, and place it whereever you like.
Then, in either your .bash_profile (mac) or .bashrc (Linux),
add something like:

alias pkill="python ~/path/to/pkill/pkill.py"

Save, and close the Terminal window, and open a new one. You're ready
to use pkill!

RUNNING PKILL
-------------
No matter where you are in your shell, just type:

pkill name-of-naughty-process

and all will be taken care of!
